# Understanding Supersymmetry

This is a note for our recreational journal club on supersymmetry (SUSY). It is not meant to be self-contained; rather it's aimed to be a supplement for the main references listed below. We try not to repeat the main references, but to document our new understandings and additional references on relevant subjects.
